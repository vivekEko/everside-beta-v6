I was discussing options for birth control and was asking for the pill.  I completely understand and would expect my doctor to present all the different options and recommend one or two that she might feel strongly about.  However, it turned into an attack.  I asked for the pill, she laid out all of the options and when I still decided that the pill was right for me, she would not let that rest.  She asked me why I did not want the IUD and I responded that I was not comfortable with a foreign object being placed inside me.  She laughed, rolled her eyes and said \\\"You people and your foreign objects.\\\"  It was rude, point blank, and extremely inappropriate.  She then tried to convince me to get a rod in my arm and I said again, that I was most comfortable with the pill.  She then asked \\\"why don't you want to try any of the other options?  The IUD is the best and you'll probably forget to take the pill\\\" to which I replied \\\"Why are you not listening to what I have to say?\\\"  It was to the point where I had to cut her off because she would not listen to me.  It made me extremely uncomfortable and I believe that she realized that she had acted inappropriately because on our way out she said \\\"glad you stood firm with your decision.\\\"  When calling to schedule a follow up appointment, I relayed to her how I felt about the whole situation and told her I would not be coming back.
